* I am a M.S. student in the [Computer Science Deparment](https://cs.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. [[Curriculum Vitae](https://albertwu96.github.io/files/wuhao_cv_2020.pdf)].
* My research interests focus on the general area of machine learning, currently thinks more about reinforcement learning theory as well as their real life applications in multi-agent systems.
* I received my Bachelor's Degree in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). My undergraduate research advisors are Prof. [Xinbing Wang](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/).
